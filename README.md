1. Title

Library Management System

2. Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a simple console-based Library Management System that automates the management of book records. The system aims to replace the traditional manual register system with a computerized solution that allows users to efficiently add, view, search, update, and delete book information using basic programming concepts.

3. Problem Statement

In many small libraries, book records are maintained manually using registers. This manual system is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to errors. Searching for a specific book or updating records requires checking multiple pages, which increases the chances of mistakes, data duplication, and data loss. To overcome these issues, a computerized Library Management System is required to manage records accurately and efficiently.

4. Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is limited to basic book record management using a console-based application. The following features are included:

Add new book records

Display all book records

Search for a book by ID or name

Update existing book information

Delete a book record

Exit the system

The project does not include a graphical user interface (GUI), database connectivity, or multi-user access.

5. Programming Language(s) and Tools

Programming Language: C++

Tools / IDEs: Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, or Visual Studio

Concepts Used: Functions, loops, conditional statements, structures/classes, arrays, and basic file handling (optional)

6. Expected Outcome

The final system provides a menu-driven interface that allows users to manage library book records efficiently. The program enables accurate record keeping, quick searching, and easy updating or deletion of book information.

7. Expected Challenges

Handling invalid or incorrect user input

Avoiding duplicate book records

Ensuring accurate search, update, and delete operations

These challenges are handled using input validation, proper conditional checks, and logical program structure.

8. System Design

The system follows a simple menu-driven design:

Display main menu

User selects an option

Corresponding function is executed

Control returns to the main menu until exit option is selected

Flowcharts are used to represent the logical flow of operations such as adding, searching, and deleting records.

9. Data Structures Used

Structure (struct): Used to store book information such as Book ID, Book Title, Author Name, and Quantity.

Arrays: Used to store multiple book records in memory.

10. Implementation Details

The program is implemented in C++ using:

Loops for menu repetition

Conditional statements for decision making

Functions for modular design (Add Book, Display Books, Search Book, Update Book, Delete Book)

Structures to store book data

Each function performs a specific task to improve code readability and maintainability.

11. Sample Input and Output

Sample Input:

Book ID: 101

Book Title: Programming Fundamentals

Author: John Smith

Quantity: 5

Sample Output:

Book record added successfully

Book details displayed correctly when searched

12. Project Screenshots

(Screenshots to be attached separately)

Main menu screen

Add book record screen

Display all books screen

Search and update record screen

Each screenshot should be properly labeled and briefly explained.

13. Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following concepts were learned:

Basic C++ programming

Use of structures and arrays

Function-based programming

File handling basics

Logical problem solving and debugging skills

14. Future Enhancements

Add file handling for permanent data storage

Implement a graphical user interface (GUI)

Add user authentication

Integrate database support

15. Conclusion

The Library Management System project successfully demonstrates the application of programming fundamentals to solve a real-world problem. The system replaces a manual record-keeping process with an automated solution that is faster, more reliable, and easier to use. This project helped in developing strong programming and logical thinking skills.
